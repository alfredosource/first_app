# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for
[*Ruby on rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*] (http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl] (http://michaelhartl.com).

I am learning this as [Alfred Denigris] (http://alfredosource.com)
Learning to program is lots of fun.  Hurray!
